0.4.0

  Added two new options to Storyboard:
  --preview [NUMBER] will output only the first NUMBER of frames that have subtitles.
    if --preview is used with -c (forcing a scene change scan), it may include more than
    NUMBER of frames, as the scene changes will also be included.

  -n [NUMBER] nudges the timestamps forward or back in time by NUMBER seconds.
    Combined with --preview this lets you more quickly line up the subtitles. Error detection
    on nudging is nonexistant, and so if you nudge them too far forward or back they could
    cause an error.

    The following example will move the subtitles back 2 seconds, and render a 25 frame PDF:

    storyboard -n -2 --preview 25 Video.mkv
